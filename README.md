Abstract: 
Background: Evidence indicates that the adverse health effects of obesity differ between genetically and environmentally influenced obesity. We examined the difference in the association between obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) between individuals with a genetically predicted low, medium, or high body mass index (BMI). 
Methods: We used data from 15,191 individuals from the Swedish Twin Registry with BMI measured between ages 40-64 and 6,592 with BMI measured at age 65 or later, and CVD information from nationwide register linkage through 2016. A polygenic score for BMI (PGSBMI) was used to define genetically predicted low, medium, or high BMI. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between BMI category and incident CVD, with an interaction term to stratify results by the PGSBMI. Co-twin control models were applied to adjust for genetic influences not captured by the PGSBMI.
Results: Midlife obesity was associated with a higher risk of CVD across all PGSBMI categories, but the association was stronger with genetically predicted lower BMI (hazard ratio ranging from 1.55 for those with high PGSBMI to 2.09 for those with low PGSBMI). Within monozygotic twin pairs, there was no difference in the association between those with genetically predicted low, medium, or high BMI, indicating that the differences are explained by other genetic factors, not captured by the PGSBMI. Associations were comparable across men and women. Results were similar when obesity was measured in late-life, but suffered from low power.
Conclusions: Although obesity was associated with CVD regardless of PGSBMI category, the results indicate that obesity influenced by genetic predisposition (genetically predicted high BMI) is less harmful than obesity influenced by environmental factors (obesity despite genetically predicted low BMI). However, additional genetic factors, not captured by the PGSBMI, still influence the associations.
